# LibreQoS cnMaestro Helper

This package provides some linkage between LibreQoS and cnMaestro. 
cnMaestro isn't a CRM - so it can't provide very much in the way of
mappings between users and plans. But it *is* a management system,
that can keep track of things like updated IP addresses, what devices
are connected where - and which devices aren't listed in your
`ShapedDevices.csv` file.
